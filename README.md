# Cipher Algorithms

Cipher algorithms have been used throughout history and even in contemporary times to protect information from those not entitled to receive it. Algorithms were made, broken, improved, broken again, improved again, broke yet again, and so on...

While algorithms are being made and broken, this repository hosts some of the basic algorithms used to cipher messages (and also decipher them).
