# Cipher Algorithms

Cipher algorithms have been used throughout history and even in contemporary times to protect information from those not entitled to receive it. Algorithms were made, broken, improved, broken again, improved again, broke yet again, and so on...

While algorithms are being made and broken, this repository hosts some of the basic algorithms used to cipher messages (and also decipher them). The implementation is done in Python 3, though can be done or ported to any other language.

# NOTES:

This repository is work-in-progress, and the implementations are based on algorithms studied in class. None of these implementations has been tested thoroughly or formally verified, and use in production envoonments without testing is not recommended.

Also important is the fact that this repository is not exhaustive and may not cover all cipher algorithms. Contributions are always welcome: just create a pull request with your contribution.
